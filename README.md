## Chosen Idea: Website with Interactive Games
### Site Owner
- As the developer of this site, I want a site that meets the criteria for a
project assigned for the completion of an Interactive Frontend Development
module, of a Software Design Course. The site should respond to the users'
actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site
displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

## User Stories
The below user stories are written for the website TimeWasters.ie. This site is
intended as a show case for the developer, and a source of entertainment for the
end user.
### General:
- As the developer of the site, I want the site to be able to grow, to include
more and more examples of interactivity.
- As the user of the site, I am looking for quick games to pass time, engage my
senses, and to be able to walk away at a moments notice.
- As the user of the site I want intuitive interactions, simplified
instructions on how to play any games, and play on any sized screen

### Home Page:
- As the developer of the site, I want the home page to provide some information
as to the purpose of the site, and to give a brief bio, so as to alert all
users to my experience and future plans.
- As the user of the site, I wan all information displayed in an intuitive
format, and to allow me to get to what I really want to do on the
site (play games, contact the developer about suggestions, project proposals,
etc…).

### Simon Says:
- As the developer of the site, I want a game that required the user to select
a difficulty, press start, and interact with the game.
- As the developer of the site, I want the game to display a random sequence
of flashing colours for the user to repeat back and get feedback to advise if
successful or not.
- As the developer of the site, I want the game’s difficulty to increase, at
predetermined stages, and for the user to be able to skip to a preferred
difficulty.
- As the user of the site, I want to be shown a colour sequence and repeat the
sequence back. I want to see the input as I am entering it so I know that it
has been accepted.
- As the user of the site, I want to know if I have succeeded or not.
- As the user of the site I want to know the difficulty level reached and be
able to restart the game once completed.

### Mastermind:
-As the developer of the site, I want a game that produces a random sequence of
colours, and the user is required to try guess the combination.
-As the developer of the site, I want there to be different difficulty levels
for the user.
-As the developer of the site, I want the user to receive feedback when they
guess correctly

### Proposed Features
#### Home Page
- Provides a brief Bio about the developer
- Provides a brief Introduction to the Site
- Provides a brief description of the games on the site

#### Simon Says!
- My take on the classic "Simon" Game by Hasbro Gaming
- Requires the user to select the desired difficulty Level
- Outputs a random sequence for the user to memorise
- Requires the user to input the sequence
- The difficulty level determines the length of the sequence and the speed
- Provides feedback to the player in the event of success/failure

#### Mastermind
- My take on the Mastermind board game by Mordecai Meirowitz
- Requires the user to select the desired difficulty Level
- Generates a random sequence of colours but does not display to the user
- The user select their guess to the sequence and selects the Guess button
- If any of the guesses are correct, the user is advised
- The last guess submitted is displayed for reference
